# What is the pair coding?

The method known as pair programming is used primarily in agile software development and, more specifically, in extreme programming (XP). The programming pair specifies that there are always two people working on code at the same time and that they sit together as much as possible. One is in charge of writing the code and the other of monitoring in real time. At the same time, they are constantly exchanging impressions: they discuss problems, find solutions and develop creative ideas.
These two workers are typically assigned different roles: the programmer who has been assigned the pilot role is in charge of writing the code. The programmer who has been assigned the copilot role is responsible for monitoring that code. One of the rules of the scheduling pair states that these two roles are exchanged regularly (at short intervals). In this way, a possible hierarchical gap is avoided: equality between both workers is promoted and a fluid exchange of roles is achieved.

While it is true that this trend or methodology raises doubts, only those who have been able to apply it are those who can offer a positive or negative comment on said methodology. Some will be in favor and give some of the following arguments:

- Increases productivity.
- Programmers learn to work as a team.
- Communication flows more often and more efficiently.
- Continuous peer learning is created and it is easier for a new team member to quickly get to work and get to know the environment.

While others might have the following negative opinions about pair programming:

- Two programmers work together much faster than one alone, but not faster than two programmers working separately.
- Increase costs (Human resource).
- Problems with each other may slow down your results.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion I must say that now that I have to use this technique it has seemed quite enjoyable since I can socialize with people I did not know and learn from them or share a little of what I know with them and help each other to meet the objectives of the matter.
