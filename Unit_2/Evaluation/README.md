## Machine Learning Mllib Spark.

In the following instructions we will return to some important imports for the realization of the problem and the perception of the data.

This data was retrieved from the repository: https://github.com/jcromerohdz/iris
We will use the Liberia Mlib that can help us in multilayer perception.
For the first step, you have to clean the data through this script.
